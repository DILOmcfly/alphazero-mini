# AlphaZero-Mini Project Rules

## Project Overview
This is a reinforcement learning project implementing a simplified AlphaZero algorithm for Connect4.
The goal is educational: building a self-learning AI from scratch.

## Technology Stack
- Language: Python 3.10+
- Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch
- Game: Connect4 (6x7 board)

## Coding Standards
- Follow PEP8 style guide (Python's official style)
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Add docstrings to all classes and functions
- Prioritize code clarity over cleverness
- Add comments explaining WHY, not WHAT (the code shows what)

## AI Assistant Behavior
- Explain complex concepts in simple terms
- When writing code, explain the logic before generating
- If multiple approaches exist, explain trade-offs
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous
- Suggest improvements when you spot inefficiencies

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- Keep the neural network simple (4-6 residual blocks max)
- Add print statements for training progress visibility
- Save checkpoints frequently (every 10 iterations)
- Use descriptive variable names (no single letters except i, j for loops)
